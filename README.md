Flask app for Discogs API - Built so I could sort and filter artist discography by 'original release year', which is no longer possible on main site

# Instructions
1. Download the repo
2. Run 'flask-search.py' from command line
3. Open browser to localhost:5000

# Demo
See working demo: https://tsnavi.pythonanywhere.com/

# Todo (pull requests welcome):
- Change filename to flask_search.py as PythonAnywhere doesn't recognise "-"
- Might be impossible with Discogs API, but more accurate 'Roles'
- Links to www.discogs pages (not api.discogs)
- CSS styling
- include thumbnail images (present in API response already, shouldn't be too difficult)
- Add instructions for self-hosting on pythonanywhere
